CSV Plugin
==========

This plugin can be used to export a GWEN_DB to a CSV stream.
CSV is a very old format which allows to transfer data between data base
programs.

This plugin uses a special configuration GWEN_DB which tells it which
column of a line is to contain which variable from the DB.

That configuation is most likely loaded from a configuration file.
Below is an example of such a file (taken from AqMoney2):

-----------------------------------------------------------------------X8
# this file contains the description of a CSV format when exporting
# transactions

# if 1 then values are quoted
quote="1"

# if 1 then a title line will be written containing the names of each
# column
title="1"

# special values are "TAB" and "SPACE"
delimiter=";" 

# this is the group name looked for in the given data to GWEN_DBIO_Export
# if not given then all groups match
#group="transaction"

# this group contains the definition for each column
# each variable in this group has its number as name
# you can use index variables in the names (using square brackets)
# the value of each of these variables is the name of a variable to be looked
# up in the data given to GWEN_DBIO_Export
columns {
  1="jobid"
  2="ouraccount/bankCode"
  3="ouraccount/accountId"
  4="otheraccount/bankCode"
  5="otheraccount/accountId"
  6="date"
  7="valutadate"
  8="value/value"
  9="value/currency"
  10="othername[0]"
  11="othername[1]"
  12="purpose[0]"
  13="purpose[1]"
  14="purpose[2]"
  15="purpose[3]"
} # columns
