This plugin reads/writes GWEN_DBs as XML files.
It knows the following parameters:

char rootElement
----------------

When exporting: This is the name of the root XML element when saving a 
GWEN_DB. If omitted then the name of the GWEN_DB group is used.

When importing: This is the name of the expected root element of the XML
file. When omitted then the root element may have any name, otherwise an
error is returned when then name of the root node does not match the value
given here.
