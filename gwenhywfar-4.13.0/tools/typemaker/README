This tool generates source and header files for simple data containers
from XML files.  It creates fromDb and toDb functions for structs and
getters and setters for any member.

This makes it easier to maintain data containers with many members (as
in AB_TRANSACTION).

A member you add to the XML file will immidiately be loaded, saved,
destroyed and copied with the rest of the struct upon request
(e.g. _fromDb() will load all members from a GWEN_DB).

The current version creates a C file and headers for it. 
Maybe I will later write code to create C++ files as well.

It also creates appropriate API documentation if provided with the
source XML file.


Usage:
 typemaker [-d DOMAIN] infile1 infile2 [...] infileN

Domain is the name of the API, e.g. for AqBanking you would choose
AQBANKING_API, for Gwen GWENHYWFAR_API etc.  This is used with the
list and heritage macros.
