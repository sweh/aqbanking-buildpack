Currently Solaris does not handle the "__attribute__ ((constructor))" 
entries in C files as it seems, so in your programs on Solaris you will
have to call GWEN_Init() yourself before doing anything else...

If programs linked against libgwenhywfar complain about unavailable libraries
upon start (most likely they mention OpenSSL) you should try this:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/ssl/lib:/usr/local/lib" YOURPROGRAM

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable tells the Solaris linker where to search for
libraries in addition to the system folders.
