This README file contains instructions to compile the test program
"gwentest.c" with the Microsoft Visual Studio compiler.

It is possible to compile gwenhywfar by some other compiler (e.g. the
mingw/gcc system) but still use the resulting DLL with some other
compiler, e.gg. the Microsoft Visual Studio C compiler (MSVC). We will
describe how to setup your MSVC project in order to use a
MSVC-compiled executable together with a gcc-compiled gwenhywfar32.dll

In order to test this possibility, according to
http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-msvcdll you need the
gwenhywfar DLL and DEF files. These are already generated
automatically when you run "make" under a Mingw system. Now, quoting
from that mingw website, "MSVC cannot use the MinGW library, but since
you have already the DEF file you may easily produce one by the
Microsoft LIB tool".

With the new libtool, there is no DEF file anymore. Nevertheless
the required LIB file can be created by the following: In the
directory gwenhywfar/src/.libs, do the following:

  dlltool --export-all-symbols -l libgwenhywfar.lib libgwenhywfar-38.dll

and this will create the libgwenhywfar.lib file needed by MSVC.

(Historical note: Previously, this was achieved by the followint:
In the directory gwenhywfar/src you have to do "lib /machine:i386
/def:gwenhywfar32.def" and there you have the gwenhywfar32.lib
file that is needed in MSVC.)

Now you need to compile gwentest.c by MSVC. We have provided a MSVC
project file in test/gwentest.vcproj. The include and library paths
should already be set up correctly, except maybe for the library path
to your mingw library directory (c:\msys\1.0\mingw\lib for me). This
might need to be adapted by right-clicking on the "gwentest" project,
then "Properties"-> "Linker"-> "General" -> "Additional library
directories", and you have to insert the directory where mingw's
library "libmingwex.a" can be found.

After that, MSVC should be able to compile and link the gwentest
program. If you run it, you don't see anything, because the program
expects some command line arguments. Therefore you have to run the
program from the command line, e.g. "gwentest.exe db"

Enjoy!
