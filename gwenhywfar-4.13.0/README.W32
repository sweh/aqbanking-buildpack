1. Using Gwenhywfar
===================

1.1. Needed Components
----------------------

1.1.1. GNU TLS

We use the precompiled packages from the wireshark project (gnutls 1.6.0)
which also contain all needed libraries such as libgcrypt and libgpg-error.




2. Compiling Gwenhywfar
=======================

2.1. Needed Components
----------------------

2.1.1. MinGW32

Gwenhywfar uses MinGW32 on Windows platforms.
MinGW32 is a project with the goal to provide a free compiler system and a
nearly complete shell environment which allows to execute the configure 
script. The resulting DLLs and EXEs only link against Windows libraries, so
there are no licence issues when releasing binary packages.
These EXEs and DLLs don't need MinGW32 to be installed on the target system.
The compiler itself is the very well known GCC.

One configure command line that used to work is the following:

  ./configure CPPFLAGS="$REGEX_INCLUDES $GNUTLS_INCLUDES $INTL_INCLUDES" \
     LDFLAGS="$REGEX_LDFLAGS -lregex $GNUTLS_LDFLAGS $INTL_LDFLAGS -lintl -liconv"

which just means you have to manually supply the -I/some/dir flags and
-L/some/dir/lib flags for libregex, libintl, libiconv, and gnutls.


2.1.2. GnuTLS

We use the precompiled packages from the wireshark project (gnutls 1.6.0)
which also contain all needed libraries such as libgcrypt and libgpg-error.
To compile gwenhywfar you will also need the developer files (ending in
*.dll.a and *.h).




3.2. Cross-compiling on Linux
-----------------------------

3.2.1. Compiling


Gwenhywfar can be cross-compiled. The author uses Debian and its mingw 
package. To compile Gwenhywfar in that environment just use the following 
commands:

>$ make -fMakefile.cvs mp-w32
>$ make
>$ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/gwen


3.2.2. Preparing Files for Shipping

You must then take the DLLs and executables (EXE) from the folder /tmp/gwen
and copy them into a folder for shipping. When preparing the application
shipping folder you should have the expected file hierarchy (see above) in
mind so that the application will find all DLLs and data.


3.2.3. Installing to the Cross-Compiler Environment

If you want to compile other projects which depend on Gwenhywfar you will
have to install some files to the cross-compilers environment. On Debian
this is /usr/i586-mingw32/. Header files go to /usr/i586-mingw32/include
and libraries must be installed to /usr/i586-mingw32/lib.
Please don't install the DLLs, only the *.dll.a files, because those are
the ones needed to compile depending projects (like AqBanking and 
Libchipcard).
