/** @file src/base/misc.h
 *
 * @short This file contains some macros concerning lists and inheritance.
 *
 * <p>
 * FIRST: Yes, I DO know, macros are very, very bad.
 * When writing these macros I spent much time debugging them, because the
 * compiler is not much of a help here.
 * The validity of a macro is only checked upon invocation,
 * so if you never use a macro it will never be checked.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, these macros do work just fine and they make some tasks
 * much easier to handle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The reason for using macros is the lack of templates in C.
 * When writing Gwenhywfar I often faced the fact that some functions always
 * appear with many structs defined. The only difference is the name of those
 * functions and the type of the arguments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The best example is the handling of lists of structs.
 * In most listable structs there was a variable called @b next which pointed
 * to the next object in the list. There were also functions like TYPE_next(),
 * TYPE_add(), TYPE_del() etc for list handling. Whenever I improved the list
 * mechanism I had to change ALL code files in order to improve them all.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These macros are now used to facilitate improvements in list or inheritance
 * handling code in C.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * @b NOTE: Please do not change these macros unless you know exactly what you
 * are doing!
 * Bugs in the macros will most probably lead to nearly undebuggable results
 * in code files using them.<br>
 * You have been warned ;-)
 * </p>
